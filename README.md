# Next.js 15 Link Component Routing Error

This repository demonstrates a routing issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application. The `Link` component from `next/link` fails to correctly navigate to another page.

## Bug Description

The application consists of two pages: `index.js` and `about.js`.  A `Link` component in `index.js` is supposed to navigate to `/about` when clicked. However, clicking the link does not render the `about.js` page; instead, the browser attempts to load `/about` as a separate request.  The expected behavior is client-side routing within the application.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `index.js` page.
5. Click the 'Go to About' link.

## Expected Behavior

The `about.js` page should render without a full page reload.  Client-side routing should handle the navigation.

## Actual Behavior

The browser attempts to load `/about` as a separate URL, resulting in a 404 error if no separate file is served for `/about`. 

## Possible Solution

Possible causes include a problem in the `next.config.js` file (missing or incorrect configuration), issues with the `app` directory structure, or incorrect usage of the `Link` component. Review the Next.js documentation for proper usage and configuration.
