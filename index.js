The issue was resolved by ensuring the `about.js` file was correctly placed within the `pages` directory and that there were no issues in the `next.config.js` file that were interfering with routing.

Additionally, verifying that the `Link` component is used correctly can be crucial. The following corrected code ensures the seamless client-side routing within the Next.js application:
```javascript
// pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app</h1>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>Go to About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```
```javascript
// pages/about.js
function About() {
  return (
    <h1>About Page</h1>
  );
}
export default About;
```
No changes to `next.config.js` were needed in this case, assuming it was correctly configured for the `pages` directory routing.
